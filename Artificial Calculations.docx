 we will preform Linear regression on multiple variables.

 three member functions: 
 1. Mean 
 2.Standard deviation 
 3. Normalization 


 After writing the code, the dat is Normalized. 


 After the Normalization is done. We will use train, test and split.
 this function will spilt our data into testing sets of data.


 note: this fucntion() -1 ; all it means is the last one
